# Optical Illusion

This project is a small decoration for your desk that doesn't require many electronics but if viewed from the correct angle looks very odd as the straight bar appears to slot through the curved flap hole. It is activated via a switch on the side and is fully enclosed with a 9V battery powering the product. 

I built this after remembering seeing it previously online as a fusion 360 render and so decided to model and print this myself to practice both modelling and sanding things. 

## BOM

- 9V battery
- x2 6mm rods cut to 113mm length
- 22mm bearing
- a Switch
- a geared DC motor
- connecting wires
- 3D printed components
